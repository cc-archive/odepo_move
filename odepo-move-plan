ODEPO move plan

Step 1:

* Identify all pages in Category:Organization from online wiki API query
* Create a list of these pages
* Append Form:Organization, Template:Organization

Step 2:

* For pages with more than one category, create a list of pages to review by-hand

Step 3:

* Make an XML dump of the CC Wiki

Step 4:

* Filter that XML dump down to just revisions of the pages we care about

Step 5:

* Import that filtered dump into the ccLearn community wiki

Step 6:

* By-hand review the pages that need by-hand review.

Step 7:

* In CC Wiki, use Special:Delete to delete the pages that had only one category

Step 8:

* In CC Wiki, review by-hand the by-hand pages

This has the benefit of keeping all page revision history.
