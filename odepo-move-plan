ODEPO move plan

Identify all pages in Category:Organization from online wiki API query
Create a list of these pages
Append Form:Organization, Template:Organization
For each of those pages, if they are in any other categories, move them to a by-hand list

Filter a wiki.cc.org XML dump down to only include those pages

Import those pages into the ccLearn community wiki
Delete them from the main CC wiki.

Take the by-hand pages, and import them, too.
